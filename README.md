# starbound-ds
Updater and installer for a starbound dedicated server

Installation

1.  Copy the script "StarboundDSAssist.sh" to your computer

2.  Launch the script with "bash StarboundDSAssist.sh"

That's pretty much it.  To start or stop or restart use the systemctl commands like so:

"sudo systemctl start starboundserver.service"

It should automatically start at startup.  I'll throw in automatic restarts soon and maybe auto-backup.
